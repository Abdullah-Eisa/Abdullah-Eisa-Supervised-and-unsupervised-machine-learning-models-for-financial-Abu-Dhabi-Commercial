## Major Steps
- applying `RandomForest` ,`Decision Tree Classifier` and `KNN` to the data to predict behaviour.

### While Columns are (Loan Term, Gender, Customer Segment, Age, Month of date, Total O_S, DPD) We divided the data into train and test data and made one-hot encoding

1) RandomForest Classifier:
Accuracy 77.10%
And after applying the GridSearch
Cross-Validation, the score is 77.79%
2) KNN:
Score 77.16%
And After applying leave one out
Cross-Validation
3) Decision Tree Classifier:
Score 77.74%
